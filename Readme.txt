It is a compiler made in c++ for a new language that has syntax of my own choice. YOu can go thorugh .mc files to get the idea of language. I have implementeed a lexer for lexeme-token pairs and parser for covering syntax issues. Next step, I am converting the code to three_address_code, a low level languagae. Finally I have vritual machine in the end to execute that three_Address_code. 
To run code on windows please go through WSL guide file in the same folder.
To run: write "make" on terminal amd then write "./a.out sample_code0.mc"
mc is our file extension abbreviation of "My Compiler".
